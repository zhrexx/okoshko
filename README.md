# Okoshko

**Okoshko** (окошко) — Russian for "little window" — is a minimalist window library for portable software rendering.

> The name draws inspiration from [zserge/fenster](https://github.com/zserge/fenster), which means "window" in German. Continuing the multilingual tradition, we chose the Russian diminutive for its charm and approachability.

## What is Okoshko?

A lightweight yet powerful, highly portable window library that gives you direct framebuffer access for software rendering. No GPU dependencies.

## Philosophy

**Okoshko** is built around a few core principles:

- **Straightforward** — Minimal API surface, obvious behavior, no surprises
- **Portable** — Write once, run anywhere (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Fast** — Efficient rendering with direct framebuffer access
- **Joyful** — Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible

## Perfect For / Where should be used

- GUI Applications
- Retro-style games and emulators
- Applications requiring precise pixel control

Or as a backbone for window creation in other libraries

## Notes
- It uses ARGB
